# simple-landing-page

I have been struggling with flexbox but here goes nothing lol

HTML & CSS have been a journey for me but ive hit a wall with flexbox.
It seems simple to under the properties individually but how they work together is like magic sometimes,
inconsistent magic that is. Im hoping this landing page will atleast get me more comfortable with the basics of css/flexbox
